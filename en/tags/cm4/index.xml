&lt;p>Only from board version 4 the higher performance DSI1 interface is used instead of the DSI0 interface of the Raspberry CM4 by the IO Base Board.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The information comes from Waveshare support, which we contacted because of our problems with the display. The change of the DSI port with version 4 of the IO Base Board is &lt;a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/CM4-IO-BASE-B#Version_Introduction">documented&lt;/a>, but unfortunately there is no reference to the missing compatibility to the display anywhere at the moment - so it is documented here &amp;hellip; ;-)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
