The error log said that the hostname of the Wireguard server could not be resolved in the client configuration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A possible cause for this could be that at the time the Wireguard server was started, the internal DNS resolver of the mobile stick (NAT/router operation) was not yet operational and resolution failed because of this. To confirm the theory and fix the error, a default name server should now be introduced, which is always the same regardless of the network connection and is available immediately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usually the currently used DNS resolver is automatically entered into the file &lt;code>/etc/resolv.conf&lt;/code> by the network management - this is also the case with Raspbian. In most cases, the DNS resolver assigned by the DHCP server of the local network is entered here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our case the setup is a bit more complicated:
Since we run Dnsmasq on the Raspi for other purposes, it has taken control of DNS name resolution and entered itself (127.0.0.1) into &lt;code>/etc/resolv.conf&lt;/code>. However, Dnsmasq itself only takes over the role of a &amp;ldquo;caching DNS resolver&amp;rdquo; - it does not make queries up to the DNS root servers itself, but uses another, external DNS resolver on the side.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But which DNS resolver is addressed by Dnsmasq?
The answer is not to be found in the Dnsmasq configuration under &lt;code>/etc/dnsmasq&lt;/code> as expected at first. A look at the table of running processes reveals that Dnsmasq was started with the &lt;code>-r&lt;/code> option:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$ sudo ps -aux
dnsmasq 647 0.0 0.1 11076 1876 ? S 10:12 0:00 /usr/sbin/dnsmasq -x /run/dnsmasq/dnsmasq.pid -u dnsmasq -r /run/dnsmasq/resolv.conf -7 /etc/dnsmasq.d,.dpkg-dist,
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;code>-r&lt;/code> stands for &lt;code>--resolv-file&lt;/code> and points to a file &lt;code>/run/dnsmasq/resolv.conf&lt;/code> which contains the upstream DNS resolvers Dnsmasq should fall back on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A look into the file reveals that the DNS resolver of our ISP has been entered there. The first line indicates that the file is generated by &lt;code>resolvconf&lt;/code>. But how can we put our own default resolver here?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In StackOverflow answers like &lt;a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/128220/how-do-i-set-my-dns-when-resolv-conf-is-being-overwritten">this&lt;/a> it is recommended to put the default nameserver in &lt;code>/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head&lt;/code> or &lt;code>base&lt;/code>. However, on our target this fails - the directory &lt;code>/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d&lt;/code> cannot be found.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason is that Raspbian &amp;ldquo;Buster&amp;rdquo; uses a different &lt;code>resolvconf&lt;/code> implementation than newer Linux distributions: &lt;code>openresolv&lt;/code>. This does not know a &lt;code>head&lt;/code> or &lt;code>base&lt;/code> file. Nevertheless it is possible to store one or more default resolvers, which are automatically added to the list of resolvers to be used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To do this, the configuration file &lt;code>/etc/resolvconf.conf&lt;/code> must be edited and a line such as the following must be added:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>name_servers=&amp;quot;9.9.9.9&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Alternatively for multiple servers e.g.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>name_servers=&amp;quot;9.9.9.9 1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>To apply the changes, Dnsmasq&amp;rsquo;s resolver file &lt;code>/run/dnsmasq/resolv.conf&lt;/code> is regenerated:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>sudo resolvconf -u /run/dnsmasq/resolv.conf
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>A check of the file shows that the default resolver (besides the network specific resolver &lt;code>10.0.0.1&lt;/code>) has been included:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>nameserver 9.9.9.9
nameserver 10.0.0.1
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>In this example, the Quad9 server 9.9.9.9 was included. To check whether this is now actually addressed during a name resolution, the following command can be issued:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>(before possibly &lt;code>apt install dnsutils&lt;/code>)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>nslookup -q=txt -class=chaos id.server.on.quad9.net
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The answer should look something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>;; Warning: Message parser reports malformed message packet.
Server: 127.0.0.1
Address: 127.0.0.1#53
Non-authoritative answer:
id.server.on.quad9.net canonical name = res120.fra.on.quad9.net.
Authoritative answers can be found from:
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>It is important that the &amp;ldquo;canonical name&amp;rdquo; ends with &amp;ldquo;quad9.net&amp;rdquo;. If a &amp;ldquo;SERVFAIL&amp;rdquo; response is returned instead, something has gone wrong and the DNS resolver is obviously not active.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
